# Maize_leaf_disease_MaxViT

Codes are barrowed from timm lab and repo. (https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models)
Edition is made on pure maxvit_tiny_tf_224 (GRN as MLP, SE module, Sclaed MaxViT)
GRN-based MLP and SE module is imported in here.
Before all this, please go to "https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models", 
train pure model then change maxxvit.py with this one.
then load trained weights with test data.

Novel Improved MaxViT-based model for identificaiton of maize leaf.
Will be updated will whole codes soon (after accpetance)
